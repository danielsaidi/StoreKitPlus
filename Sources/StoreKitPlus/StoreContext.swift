import StoreKit

/**
 This class can be used to manage store information in a way
 that makes it observable.

 You can use a ``StandardStoreService`` to sync product info
 with this context, which will update the ``products`` array
 with matching products.

 Since a StoreKit `Product` is not `Codable`, the ``products``
 array is not permanently persisted. This means that it will
 reset when the app is restarted. Due to this, there is also
 a ``productIds`` property that is permanently persisted. It
 gives you the option to map ``productIds`` to local product
 representations whenever the app can't access StoreKit.

 However, a StoreKit `Product` instance is needed to perform
 a purchase. If the app fails to fetch products, e.g. if the
 app is offline, you should show a spinner or an error alert
 to inform users that product information can't be retrieved.
