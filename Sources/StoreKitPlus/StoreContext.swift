import StoreKit

/// This observable class can manage store-based information
/// in a way that makes it observable.
///
/// You can use the ``StandardStoreService`` to sync product
/// info with this context, which will update the ``products``
/// array with matching products.
///
/// Since StoreKit `Product` isn't `Codable`, the ``products``
/// array is not permanently persisted, which means that the
/// property will reset when the app is restarted.
///
/// Due to this, there's also a ``productIds`` property that
/// is permanently persisted. It gives you the option to map
/// ``productIds`` to local product representations whenever
/// the app can't access StoreKit.
///
/// However, a StoreKit `Product` value is needed to perform
/// a purchase. If your app fails to fetch products, e.g. if
/// it's offline, you should show a spinner or an alert that
/// informs your users that your products can't be retrieved.
